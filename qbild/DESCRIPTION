Description: This project follows Rahman and Vossmeyer (2019) as its motivating literature,    
   and contributes to the three literatures by extending the various methodologies to a 
   hierarchical Bayesian quantile regression model for binary longitudinal data (QBLD) 
   and proposing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate the model. 
   The model handles both common (fixed) and individual-specific (random) parameters 
   (commonly referred to as mixed effects in statistics). The algorithm implements 
   a blocking procedure that is computationally efficient and the distributions involved 
   allow for straightforward calculations of covariate effects.
